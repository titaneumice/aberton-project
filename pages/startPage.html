<p>Hey. What’s up? This are will navigate “text adventure style” on a page by page basis.</p>

<p>To the left are character portraits - they should indicate “unselectable” and “currently selected”. I’m also debating putting the character stats there to be visible at all times…or to have a dialogue pop up when they’re clicked on to take a look, and then select. Depends on how many stats there will be. (A lot, probably.)</p>

<p>To the right will be a clock with some sort of date, and then below it the inventory. I don’t know if there will really be much of an inventory yet, but it will be character wide.</p>

<p><a>Boop the inventory.</a></p>

<p>Up top is a banner. Maybe it’ll change as stuff happens…or do nothing at all.</p>

<p>I had considered other things, like right here I might’ve implemented tabs for each area, but I think I’d rather someone click to move in this window, because there could be a lot of “places”. Also, this is not necessarily going to be in black and white! It just is for now. The general tone for the GUI is going to be “grayscale” or “sepia”. Or…maybe an equivalent in blue.</p>

<p>Now I’m going to make sure this area can scroll.</p>

<p>AAAA</p>

<p>AAAA</p>

<p>AAAaaaaAAA</p>

<p>AaaaAAa</p>

<p>aaaa</p>

<p>aaa……….</p>

<p>Does it work?</p>
