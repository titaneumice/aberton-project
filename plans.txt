1. how about every time a loop starts (on load or new game) warn players that reloading the page may lose progress?
    see, im not actually sure how to prevent data loss at this point (especially if something - say Chrome for example
    reload a page automatically for whatever reason)
2. day begins. every time an action is chosen, it is locked in for a character and the player is PROMPTED
    to select another character to act. this means i have to create a dialogue box, i think?
        - need "hasActed" and "isAvailable" properties - isAvailable, when false, would prevent a character
            from showing up in the prompt at all
3. I need to check if what I do in the main iframe can effect anything in the main view, like, at all.
    That's a big thing.
        - do all of the banners need to be iframes for me to update them?
            I can only think of, maybe, each iframe be caused to reload...

pages:
    newGame
        start day loop, include Prologue, set parameters to starting parameters, new file class or something idk
    loadIn
        start day loop, loading save data
        possibly load in at the correct time of day as well


footer:
    save and load from down here - generate game data into plain text and provide to player on save.
    load in requires players pasting that plain text in.
        potential issue: without any kind of secrecy, this could easily be used to cheat
